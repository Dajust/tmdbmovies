# tmdbmovies

## How to run the code

You'll need to have your TMDB API_key to run this app.

Once you have your API KEY, provide the key by creating a `.env` file at the root folder,then paste the following:

```
APIKEY=myapikey**********a
```

Next, install dependencies. From the root, run `yarn install` or `npm install`. After installing, start the app by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. The app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Explanation of architecture

The code is written in a very basic React Hooks architecture. Using `emotion`, the app is styled with the `css-in-js` architecture.
